Students often find themselves in situations where they need update
on things like their attendance or the events taking place in the
college and also companies which will be visiting college for
recruitment. So, we need to develop an application where students
can get all the required information and also a go to place where
they can keep track of their marks.

• Exclusively for DBIT students.
• Get all the updates regarding all the events conducted
important notices.
• The further scope will let the faculty members update
any new.
